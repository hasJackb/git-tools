# Git Tools

Handy tools for working with Git/GitHub.

## Code Review

Run `code-review.sh` with unstaged changes to view the top 2 committers on
the changes you've made.

### TODO

* Use intelligent diffs instead of status so that you can work across
  multiple commits;
* Allow whitelisting and blacklisting people from the blames;
* Support selecting how many people you want returned;
* Roll-up emails into 'people' so you don't get the same person with
  multiple emails;
* Figure out how to use this with hooks or webhooks.
